Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Log

A simple tic-tac-toe game written in JavaScript and HTML5.  Download the tic-tac-toe.html file along with the two accompanying folders "style" and "js" to your desktop or to a folder of your choice.

Simply open the file "tic-tac-toe.html" in your browser.  Player 1 and Player 2 will need to take turns with the mouse and click their desired squares.  The moves are noted on both sides of the playing board as the game proceeds.  A winner is declared once one of the winning combinations have been achieved.  You can only click on a single square once per game.  If the game is a draw, a message below the board will appear.

Enjoy the game!
