Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Log

A simple tic-tac-toe game written in JavaScript and HTML5.  Using the "Download Zip" button, download and extract all files and folders to your desktop or to another folder of your choice.

Once extracted, browser the main folder and open the file "tic-tac-toe.html" in your browser.  As this is a head-to-head computer only game, gameplay starts immediately.  The moves are noted on both sides of the playing board as the game proceeds.  A winner (there is never a winner) is declared once one of the winning combinations have been achieved.  If the game is a draw, a message below the board will appear.  As each computer player starts the game with the same way and has a prescribed response to each move, a winner is not possible - only draws and the game plays out the same way each time.
